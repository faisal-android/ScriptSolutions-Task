App contains a top image carousel with indicator and city listing. Carousel contains GCC countries' images. As user changes Coursal item by swiping, A list at bottom shows some of cities of selected country. User can search cities by typing in SearchView.

Task is done without using any third party library. Although it was a small task still I tried to add most of components of Good Design Pattern practices of Android Development like,

ViewModel & ViewModel Factory, LiveData, Repository Structure, Coroutines, Recyclerview, Motionlayout

Note: Images for Cities list are same as country image to save the time.
